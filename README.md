| Form Parameter | default | description |
| --- 						| --- | --- |
| `name` 					        | | plugin name `kong-oidc-auth` |
| `config.authorize_url` 	| | authorization url of the OAUTH provider (the one to which you will be redirected when not authenticated) |
| `config.scope` 			    | | OAUTH scope of the authorization request |
| `config.pfidpadapterid` <br /> <small>Optional</small> 	    | | OAUTH PingFederate Adaptor ID of the authorization request ex: CompanyIdOIDCStage, essentially points to the idp environment, ping federate specific only |
| `config.token_url` 		  | | url of the Oauth provider to request the access token |
| `config.client_id` 		  | | OAUTH Client Id |
| `config.client_secret` 	| | OAUTH Client Secret |
| `config.user_url` 		  | | url of the oauth provider used to retrieve user information and also check the validity of the access token |
| `config.user_keys` <br /> <small>Optional</small>		| `username,email` | keys to extract from the `user_url` endpoint returned json, they will also be added to the headers of the upstream server as `X-OAUTH-XXX` |
| `config.hosted_domain`  | | domain whose users must belong to in order to get logged in. Ignored if empty |
| `config.email_key` 		  | | key to be checked for hosted domain, taken from userinfo endpoint |
| `config.user_info_periodic_check` 		  | 60 | time in seconds between token checks |
| `config.salt` 		  | b3253141ce67204b | salt for the user session token, must be 16 char alphanumeric |
| `config.service_logout_url`         | | The URL for logouts in your IAM provider. Will be redirected to this URL when hitting urls ending in `/logout` |
| `config.app_login_redirect_url` 		  | | Needed for Single Page Applications to redirect after initial authentication successful, otherwise a proxy request following initial authentication would redirect data directly to a users browser! |
| `config.cookie_domain` 		  | | Specify the domain in which this cookie is valid for, realistically will need to match the gateway |
| `config.user_info_cache_enabled` 		  | | This enables storing the userInfo in Kong local cache which enables sending the entire requested user information to the backend service upon every request, otherwise user info only comes back occasionally and backend api service providers are required to validate the EOAuth Cookie Session with cached user information within their logic |
| `config.realm`        | | (Optional) This value will be passed as `X-Oauth-realm` _if and only if_ it is included as part of the request URL. |
| `config.allowed_roles`        | | (Optional) An array of roles, any of which should grant access to this route. This will be checked against the `groups` field from your OIDC providers userinfo endpoint. You _must_ make roles available as userinfo.groups for this to work, otherwise enabling this option will block all users as their roles will not be retrievable. |

Data available from the userinfo endpoint and included in the `config.user_keys` section will be included as headers following the pattern `X-Oauth-{field}` to upstream services.

NOTES:
Ping Federate requires you to authorize a callback URL, all proxies have a standard call back route of:
https://api-gateway.company.com/your/proxy/path/oauth2/callback
